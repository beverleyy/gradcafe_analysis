Mine was a late admit because I reached out to a professor late, followed up with him, and received an invitation to a Zoom conversation during which this POI verbally accepted me. I received the acceptance letter and funding two days later, and I will most likely be accepting it. You will NOT get admitted to this program unless you have contacted a professor at some point in the application process. I'd go so far as to suggest you to send an email to your professor as early as September and ask him or her if they are taking any new students, making sure that you submit an application with their name if they say yes. The earlier you get in touch with a faculty member, the better your chances might be. This program truly does rolling admissions, so just reach out to a faculty member whose research you might like if you haven't heard anything yet. Best of luck to next cycle's applicants!"

Thank you for applying to graduate study at UCLA. We regret to inform you that you are not being offered admission.

UCLA receives many more applications than there are student places available. Each of these applications is carefully reviewed by a departmental faculty committee. In this extremely competitive environment, many talented and promising students are not recommended for admission by these committees.

We understand that this decision is disappointing, and again, there are many more applications than there are places available. Inquiries about your application or the decision may be submitted in writing to: Graduate Admissions Officer, Aerospace Engineering, 48-121 Engineering IV, Box 951597, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1597, maeapp@seas.ucla.edu."

Dear Carson Cortez:

Thank you for your interest in the Aeronautics and Astronautics graduate program at MIT. You clearly have many strengths, but unfortunately we cannot offer you admission to our department at this time. Our committee selects from a large and talented pool of applicants each year (this year fewer than 8% of applicants were admitted), and we are truly sorry that we cannot extend to you, and many other strong students, the invitation to study with us for September 2021.

We wish you much success as you take the next steps in your studies and your career.

Sincerely,

Graduate Admissions Committee

: We only invited students that have met the requirements for admission to our graduate program.

 

2. During Virtual Visit Day, do I have to find my potential advisor and secure commitment for my funding? to be considered for admission? 
: Students in the PHD program must have a faculty member who will advise their program and provide funding.  If you do not find an advisor we can recode your admission to a later semester to allow you more time to fine one.

 

3. How can I make appointments with AE faculties who I'm interested in? there seems to be no guideline in this email.

My GPA is pretty good for attending a rigorous & competitive undergraduate program (no where a near a 4.0 lol). I was a community college transfer.  I did not report my GRE scores on my application (nothing stellar). I have one third author publication in a high impact journal pending. I've had two industry internships and conducted research at a national lab. 

I noticed the national lab I worked hires people from many different schools (including many that I've never heard of). I think fit is the most important thing for grad school. In the grand scheme of things I think what matters more is your personal effort and attitude."

Being placed on the wait list indicates that faculty are interested in working with you on your graduate studies, however, based on our estimated acceptance rate of admission offers, we do not believe we will have an opening for you at this time. Given the uncertainty on the exact number of admitted students that will accept our offer of admission, we do place a small number of applicants on the wait list. 

I am sorry that we cannot predict the final outcome of your application for admission at the present time. As the situation evolves, we may admit students from the wait list, and that could happen any time from now until the end of May. We will notify all wait-listed applicants of a final decision no later than May 31, 2019."

Actually, how did you guys write your statement of objectives? I tried to follow what is on the department website. For me I had to explain my somewhat messy background, discuss goals/objectives, and general research interests since I don't have a very specific one such as ""studying boundary layer flows"". But i didn't touch on my research experiences, which I left inside the CV/resume section of the application.

The number of admission offers available at Princeton for entering graduate students is extremely limited, and we cannot offer admission to all applicants who are well-qualified. Indeed, many departments consistently have applicants who would be admitted without hesitation if additional resources were available. Our decisions take into account not only the applicants' merits but also the suitability of the programs to the candidates' expressed interests. Our goal is to achieve a sound match between the strengths of our programs and the interests of the relatively small number of outstanding students that can be accommodated.
