I received the acceptance letter and funding two days later, and I will most likely be accepting it. You will NOT get admitted to this program unless you have contacted a professor at some point in the application process. I'd go so far as to suggest you to send an email to your professor as early as September and ask him or her if they are taking any new students, making sure that you submit an application with their name if they say yes. The earlier you get in touch with a faculty member, the better your chances might be.

Thank you for applying to graduate study at UCLA. We regret to inform you that you are not being offered admission.

UCLA receives many more applications than there are student places available. Each of these applications is carefully reviewed by a departmental faculty committee. In this extremely competitive environment, many talented and promising students are not recommended for admission by these committees.

We understand that this decision is disappointing, and again, there are many more applications than there are places available. Inquiries about your application or the decision may be submitted in writing to: Graduate Admissions Officer, Aerospace Engineering, 48-121 Engineering IV, Box 951597, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1597, maeapp@seas.ucla.edu."

Dear Carson Cortez:

Thank you for your interest in the Aeronautics and Astronautics graduate program at MIT. You clearly have many strengths, but unfortunately we cannot offer you admission to our department at this time. Our committee selects from a large and talented pool of applicants each year (this year fewer than 8% of applicants were admitted), and we are truly sorry that we cannot extend to you, and many other strong students, the invitation to study with us for September 2021.

We wish you much success as you take the next steps in your studies and your career.

Sincerely,

Graduate Admissions Committee
Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics

2. During Virtual Visit Day, do I have to find my potential advisor and secure commitment for my funding? to be considered for admission? 
: Students in the PHD program must have a faculty member who will advise their program and provide funding.  If you do not find an advisor we can recode your admission to a later semester to allow you more time to fine one.

 

3. How can I make appointments with AE faculties who I'm interested in? there seems to be no guideline in this email.

While I assure you that the materials you submitted were carefully reviewed by the faculty in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, I regret to inform you that the department did not recommend your admission for the coming academic year.




The number of admission offers available at Princeton for entering graduate students is extremely limited, and we cannot offer admission to all applicants who are well-qualified. Indeed, many departments consistently have applicants who would be admitted without hesitation if additional resources were available. Our decisions take into account not only the applicants' merits but also the suitability of the programs to the candidates' expressed interests. Our goal is to achieve a sound match between the strengths of our programs and the interests of the relatively small number of outstanding students that can be accommodated. 




I wish you success in your plans for graduate study and thank you for considering Princeton University."
