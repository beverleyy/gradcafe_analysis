I received the acceptance letter and funding two days later, and I will most likely be accepting it. You will NOT get admitted to this program unless you have contacted a professor at some point in the application process. I'd go so far as to suggest you to send an email to your professor as early as September and ask him or her if they are taking any new students, making sure that you submit an application with their name if they say yes. The earlier you get in touch with a faculty member, the better your chances might be. This program truly does rolling admissions, so just reach out to a faculty member whose research you might like if you haven't heard anything yet. Best of luck to next cycle's applicants!"

Also, this virtual visit was held for EMERGE participants which basically meant that when I took the GRE I chose to let EMERGE use my info to send to colleges. Regarding the comments about the virtual visit being held in March, I too have been receiving those emails so I do not know if that means people made it past the first round of admission.  As for my qualifications to get in, I had a 3.62 Major GPA in Mechanical Engineering from University of California, Merced and I have only done one semester of research (which I am doing this semester).

1. Does this mean that I passed the first round of the admission process? Or Is this email distributed to all applicants?  
: We only invited students that have met the requirements for admission to our graduate program.

 

2. During Virtual Visit Day, do I have to find my potential advisor and secure commitment for my funding? to be considered for admission? 
: Students in the PHD program must have a faculty member who will advise their program and provide funding.  If you do not find an advisor we can recode your admission to a later semester to allow you more time to fine one.

 

3. How can I make appointments with AE faculties who I'm interested in? there seems to be no guideline in this email.

Given the uncertainty on the exact number of admitted students that will accept our offer of admission, we do place a small number of applicants on the wait list. 

I am sorry that we cannot predict the final outcome of your application for admission at the present time.

Your record and qualifications are excellent, and we have no doubt of your ability to earn an advanced degree and that you will have a successful career.  We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

Really their loss!  the funny part is where they say ""Your record and qualifications are excellent"" and they don't grant me an admission! ( I suppose there is nothing better than excellent, right? )  I got a better offer from another top school. It just shows how subjective these admission processes are."
