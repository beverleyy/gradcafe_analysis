For future applicants, here are some relevant statistics from the visit days (keep in mind this is from a COVID year, so that might affect future statistics):
- 48 / 506 admitted students (~9.5%)
- 15 / 48 international (2 from Canada)
- 13 / 48 have MS or equivalent (some obtained alongside the BS, some after)
- 85-90% of admitted students accept the offer historically

The undergraduate institutions of the incoming class are probably a lot more varied than people would think. If you're reading this in the future, good luck! I hope this was helpful."

My advice is to reach out to potential faculty you want to work with and try and get them to advocate for you. Its unlikely you will get admitted otherwise"
