Note to future international applicants of MIT or Stanford ME: minimize your expectations. You have to compete with Americans with NSF fellowships & many research or internship opportunities during their undergrad (including at MIT/Stanford itself), and with international applicants from the ""right"" universities or labs. And then IMO you need LORs from people strongly affiliated with MIT/Stanford. And even then you have to get very lucky still.  If you look at member s of any lab, it's obvious that it's extremely rare for someone to get accepted without ticking all those boxes which are not really in our control in the end.

I think UW is really trying to push the limit of their admission process in a sense that they don't want to accept a single more student if he/she is not absolute indispensable. I guess the reason why the admission process took so long is because they're waiting response from some other students that they've sent offer to. We, who are on the waitlist, are basically waiting for those students' rejection response, or otherwise, it's gonna be a ""rejection"" for us. Fortunately, since there is the ""April 15 resolution"", I guess all students should make their decisions before that, which means we'll also get our results by that date."

Thank you for applying to graduate study at UCLA. We regret to inform you that you are not being offered admission.

UCLA receives many more applications than there are student places available. Each of these applications is carefully reviewed by a departmental faculty committee. In this extremely competitive environment, many talented and promising students are not recommended for admission by these committees.

We understand that this decision is disappointing, and again, there are many more applications than there are places available. Inquiries about your application or the decision may be submitted in writing to: Graduate Admissions Officer, Aerospace Engineering, 48-121 Engineering IV, Box 951597, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1597, maeapp@seas.ucla.edu."

To answer questions about preview day below, the preview day is just the interview of ME Ph.D. program and during non-pandamic period, it should be a two-day on-campus interview with your chosen profs. According to my knowledge, funding is always the problem for any ME Ph.D. program, which may affect the admission process a lot. My suggestion for this program is that don't overdoubt things. I personally think people in charge of graduate admission at UCB ME are really great and care their applicants, based on my interaction with them. However, it's a fact that it might take longer for any decision to be made here, probably due to funding consideration I guess."

I noticed the national lab I worked hires people from many different schools (including many that I've never heard of). I think fit is the most important thing for grad school. In the grand scheme of things I think what matters more is your personal effort and attitude."

I did the same when I just finished my bachelor's degree. I wanted to go straight to grad school. I didn't apply for 29 programs tho, I only applied to one program and one scholarship. I failed. I moved one. I started to get a small job with a very low salary, then went to a big company job with a high salary. It took me more than 5 years to get back to grad school. Before I got in with full funding packages, I applied to many programs like you, received many rejections and acceptances as well from all over the world. I am the first generation with formal education as well. But, I never bring that card to my admission process or anything. I have dealt with many rejections in my life; admissions, a love-life, identity, social class, job applications, etc. I survive. I guess I am way older than you.

On behalf of the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Admissions Committee at the University of Michigan, I regret to inform you that your application has not been selected for admission to our graduate program.

Many factors are considered in our admission process. These include academic potential and scholarship, as well as the number of research openings within our faculty laboratories, and achieving a balance among areas of interest in the graduate student cohort. The University of Michigan is committed to recruiting a diverse, talented student body; please note that this admission decision was not impacted by changes to national immigration policy."

Was a GPA 4.0 master student in Mechanical Engineering at Umich (Also undergrad from top USA engineering program, full-time work experience in top-notch company, several pubs and patents). 
Key takeaways from this application (advice for future Umich admits): 1. Do not trust the downgraded master offer (admit into master instead of phd) from the umich! The master admission offer may mention you can ""transfer"" (change of program) into the phd program during your master, but trust me, the ""transfer"" process would be identical in terms of difficulty as directly application. The selectivity for the master is around 20% so the school just wanna attract the CASH from the master admits's tuitions (tuition is extremely high considering Umich is a public school). The financial assistantship are very limited for master students.
2. You must contact and secure some POI (rich POI with funding) or high chance you will be rejected (the POI makes most decisions while admission committee makes very few). 
I will take phd offers from other top (higher ranking) engineering school. VERY disappointment in Michigan ! ! !"

Early Jan I got a reply from an academic saying that he saw my email and was interested in my research and has put me in a pool of applicants for three positions he had. Since then I've been in touch and scheduled an interview (no other academics got back to me). On the morning of the interview (6th of Feb), I got offered a  place, without the mention of any funding however. We discussed some fellowship paths as well as was told it takes about two weeks to announce all TAs. My takeaway from my admission in Michigan too is that you should contact academics with SPECIFIC research interests. I've made a google drive for each uni which I link whenever I email people.

This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of rejection letters. With such a varied and promising field of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.

Despite Kaustâ€™s outstanding qualifications and previous experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at this time. Therefore, I will assume the position of assistant professor in your department this Fall. I look forward to seeing you then.

The materials you submitted with your application have been carefully reviewed by the admissions committee, but we are unable to recommend you for admission.
The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee has the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants. Unfortunately, this may result in not being able to accept many applicants who are capable of excellent academic work.

The number of admission offers available at Princeton for entering graduate students is extremely limited, and we cannot offer admission to all applicants who are well-qualified. Indeed, many departments consistently have applicants who would be admitted without hesitation if additional resources were available. Our decisions take into account not only the applicants' merits but also the suitability of the programs to the candidates' expressed interests.

I would like to move my application to Spring 2016. However, I would want to inquire the following about the admission procedure :

1. Was my application was at all reviewed at any stage Or it remained oblivious to all faculty members? If it was not at all reviewed then there might be a chance that my application is not strong( although your previous mail states that -Although you were a strong applicant to our graduate program )..

2. If I move my application to Spring 2016, will I able to add some more recommendation letters to my application.

Following reply came :
We have moved your application to Spring 2016.  Your file is complete, so there is nothing else for you to submit.
 
                Our e-mail to you was a little misleading.  As soon as you submitted your online application, it was loaded onto our database for all faculty to review, so yes, your file was reviewed.  That is the reason we are reaching out to you to move your application to Spring  2016.  Since you have applied for the Direct PhD, we do not admit PhD applicants without firm funding from our ME faculty.  So, the Graduate Committee felt you have a strong application, but funding was not available.  We highly encourage our PhD applicants to contact our ME faculty which best parallels your research interests.   
                Unfortunately, once you submit your application online, you cannot go back into it and make changes or add items.  We cannot update your file for you electronically either.

Dear [my name]:


I just wanted to let you know your application is still with the admissions committee.  There is no definitive time when they expect to finish but I will keep you updated and of course, if a decision is made, I will notify you promptly even if it is off hours or on the weekend.

We had a highly unusual number of applications this year and it has taken longer than normal for the faculty to review all the applications.

We appreciate your patience.

The materials you submitted with your application have been carefully reviewed by the admissions committee, but we are unable to recommend you for admission. The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee has the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants. Unfortunately, this may result in not being able to accept many applicants who are capable of excellent academic work.

long to get a decision to you, and we know April 15 is fast approaching. If
you have to make decisions regarding other schools, we understand.

It is possible that you may be admitted to our department after April 15. If
that is the case, we will of course give you time to make your decision.  As
soon as a decision has been made regarding your application, we will let you
