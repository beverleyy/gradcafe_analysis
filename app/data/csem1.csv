Double majored in M.E. and Math at a pretty alright university (ranked like 70-ish nationally), POI said double major was a big plus. Had a few years of research experience with publications. For future applicants: big emphasis on GRE quant score, my verbal score was probably a fluke but I ended up retaking quant (bumped it from 166 to 170) on professor's advice.
